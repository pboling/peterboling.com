# Tokens used by ci:act and CI helpers for reading workflow/pipeline status via APIs
# GitHub (either GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN will be used; fine-grained recommended)
# - Scope/permissions: For fine-grained tokens, grant repository access (Read) and Actions: Read
# - For classic tokens, public repos need no scopes; private repos typically require repo
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your GH token for GHA status; NEVER COMMIT>
# Alternatively:
# export GH_TOKEN=<your GH token>

# GitLab (either GITLAB_TOKEN or GL_TOKEN will be used)
# - Scope: read_api is sufficient to read pipelines
export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your GitLab token for pipeline status; NEVER COMMIT>
# Alternatively:
# export GL_TOKEN=<your GitLab token>

# RubyGems.org username
export RUBYGEMS_HANDLE=<your RubyGems.org handle for publishing gems; NEVER COMMIT>
