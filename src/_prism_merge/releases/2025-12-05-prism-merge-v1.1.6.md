## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-05

- TAG: [v1.1.6][1.1.6t]
- COVERAGE: 98.31% -- 929/945 lines in 9 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 87.08% -- 391/449 branches in 9 files
- 100.00% documented

### Fixed

- **Fixed duplicate content when freeze blocks precede nodes with leading comments**: When a freeze block appeared before a node that had leading comments attached from earlier in the file, the merge would output duplicate content. Fixed by:
  - Filtering out comments inside freeze blocks from being attached as leading comments to subsequent nodes
  - Not including leading comments in anchor ranges when other nodes exist between the comments and the node
  - Extending `extract_node_body` to include content after the last statement up to the closing line, ensuring freeze blocks at the end of block bodies are preserved
