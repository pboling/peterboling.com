Seed Migrations are a way to manage changes to seed data in a rails app in a similar way to how schema migrations are handled.

A data migration library, similar to rails built-in schema migration. It also auto generates a `db/seeds.rb` file, similar to how schema migrations generate the `db/schema.rb` file.
Using this auto generated seed file makes it quick and easy to setup new environments, usually development or test.
