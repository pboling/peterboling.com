Ruby on Rails is a powerful web application framework that makes it easy to build modern web applications. In this post, we'll explore the basics of getting started with Rails.

## Why Rails?

Rails follows the "convention over configuration" principle, which means you can get started quickly without spending hours configuring your application.

## Installation

To install Rails, you'll need Ruby installed on your system. Then, simply run:

```bash
gem install rails
```

## Creating Your First App

Create a new Rails application with:

```bash
rails new my_app
cd my_app
rails server
```

And that's it! Your Rails application is now running on `http://localhost:3000`.

Rails makes web development enjoyable and productive. Happy coding!
