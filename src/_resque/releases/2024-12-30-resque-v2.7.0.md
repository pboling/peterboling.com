## Special Notes
Just wanted to give everyone a heads up, that after this version, we're going to start dropping support for older versions of Ruby. The larger ecosystem has moved on and continuing to support the Ruby 2.x branch is proving to be impossible. While Resque will likely continue to work on older versions of Ruby, as we move towards Resque 3, we're going to shift to officially supporting rubies that are still supported and maintained.

I want to thank everyone who contributed to Resque and the associated plugins this year. It's not easy maintaining a widely used project while also holding down a fairly demanding set of personal and professional responsibilities. Everyone's patience and contributions has been greatly appreciated.
