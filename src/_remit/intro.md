Remit =====

This API provides access to the Amazon Flexible Payment Service (FPS). After
trying to get the SOAP version of the API written, I began working on this REST
version to provide a cohesive means of access to all of the functionality of
the FPS without having to get dirty dealing with SOAP requests.

### Getting Started
