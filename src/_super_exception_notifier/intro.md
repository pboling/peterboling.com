**NOTE: This is a legacy gem, for rails 2.x**

The Super Exception Notifier (SEN) gem provides a mailer object and a default set of templates for sending email notifications when errors occur in a Rails application, as well as a default set of error page templates to render based on the status code assigned to an error.
