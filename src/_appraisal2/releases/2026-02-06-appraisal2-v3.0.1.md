## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-06

- TAG: [v3.0.1][3.0.1t]
- COVERAGE: 77.11% -- 603/782 lines in 27 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 83.96% -- 89/106 branches in 27 files
- 43.03% documented

### Added

- Support for [ore-light](https://github.com/contriboss/ore-light) as an alternative gem manager via `--gem-manager=ore` CLI option
  - New `GemManager::OreAdapter` class implementing ore-light integration
  - New `GemManager::BundlerAdapter` class (extracted from existing bundler logic)
  - New `GemManager::Factory` class for creating gem manager adapters
  - New `GemManager::Base` abstract base class defining the gem manager interface
  - New `OreNotAvailableError` and `UnknownGemManagerError` error classes
  - Acceptance tests for ore install and update commands (tagged with `:ore` metadata for conditional execution)
  - Unit tests for all gem manager adapter classes
  - README documentation for ore usage, including installation, CLI options, and example workflows
- New `-g` / `--gem-manager` CLI option to select gem manager (bundler or ore) for install/update commands
- New `Appraisal::Customize.reset!` class method to reset customization state (useful for testing)
- Improved test coverage from 66.7% to 76.4% line coverage, 61.5% to 77.4% branch coverage
  - New unit tests for `BundlerDSL` class (including APPRAISAL_INDENTER variations)
  - New unit tests for `Command` class
  - New unit tests for `Conditional` class
  - New unit tests for `Source` class
  - New unit tests for `Git` class
  - New unit tests for `Path` class
  - New unit tests for `OrderedHash` class
  - New unit tests for `Dependency` class
  - New unit tests for `Group` class
  - New unit tests for `Platform` class
  - New unit tests for `GemManager::Factory` class
  - New unit tests for error classes (`AppraisalsNotFound`, `OreNotAvailableError`, `UnknownGemManagerError`)
  - Enhanced `DependencyList` tests with edge cases
  - Enhanced `Gemfile` tests with load/run/dup edge cases
- Added documentation on hostile takeover of RubyGems
  - https://dev.to/galtzo/hostile-takeover-of-rubygems-my-thoughts-5hlo
- CLI configs for RuboCop, RubyGems, YARD, and JRuby (for local development only)

### Changed

- Improved test isolation for acceptance tests to prevent modification of parent project's Gemfile.lock
  - Added `BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG` isolation to prevent reading/writing parent's `.bundle/config`
  - Added explicit `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` prefix to all bundle commands in tests
  - Added `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE` environment variable to explicitly control where lockfiles are written
  - Set `BUNDLE_IGNORE_FUNDING_REQUESTS` and `BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS` for cleaner test output
  - Added `BUNDLE_USER_CACHE` isolation to prevent polluting user's gem cache
  - Fixed overly broad `File` stubs in unit tests that interfered with RSpec error formatting
  - Changed `bundle_without_spec.rb` to use `skip_for` instead of `pending_for` to prevent test setup from running on unsupported Ruby versions (which was polluting the project Gemfile.lock with test gems)
- YARD CLI config switch from custom Kramdown support to yard-fence

### Fixed

- Fixed `BundlerAdapter#install` not passing `gemfile_path` to `Command.new`, which caused bundler to potentially write to the wrong Gemfile.lock when `Bundler.with_original_env` reset the environment
- Fixed ore-light adapter path resolution: ore now runs from the gemfile's directory so relative path dependencies resolve correctly (ore resolves paths relative to working directory, not gemfile location)
- Fixed Thor `invoke(:generate, [])` call in `update` command to pass empty options hash, preventing argument leakage

### Security

- Ore adapter now uses array-based command construction for `Kernel.system` calls instead of string interpolation, preventing potential shell injection vulnerabilities
