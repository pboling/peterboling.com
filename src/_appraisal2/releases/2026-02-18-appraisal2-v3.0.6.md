## [3.0.6] - 2026-02-17

- TAG: [v3.0.6][3.0.6t]
- COVERAGE: 88.34% -- 727/823 lines in 27 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.05% -- 127/167 branches in 27 files
- 43.11% documented

### Added

- Test for bundler handling with pre-existing appraisal lockfiles
  - Added acceptance test that verifies appraisal correctly handles `gemfiles/*.gemfile.lock` files with `BUNDLED WITH` specified
  - Test validates that:
    - Appraisal gemfiles with pre-created lockfiles install correctly
    - Lockfiles preserve the `BUNDLED WITH` section reporting which bundler version was used
    - The bundler version in the lockfile is correctly maintained during installation
  - Note: Multi-version bundler switching in CI would require pre-installing multiple bundler versions; coverage is limited to lockfile preservation and environment handling.

### Fixed

- Restore bundler's automatic version switching for modern bundler versions (2.2+)
  - Bundler can detect and switch to the version specified in `Gemfile.lock` (or appraisal lockfiles) via `BUNDLED WITH`
  - Previously, `with_original_env` stripped all bundler-related variables, preventing bundler from detecting version mismatches and breaking test isolation
  - Now uses `with_bundler_env` with selective cleanup:
    - Starts from `Bundler.original_env` when available
    - Preserves critical bundler and isolation variables (for example: `BUNDLE_GEMFILE`, `BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG`, `BUNDLE_PATH`, `BUNDLE_USER_CACHE`)
    - Removes `BUNDLER_SETUP` and `BUNDLER_VERSION` activation markers
    - Removes `bundler/setup` from `RUBYOPT` to prevent auto-activation in subprocesses
    - Prevents `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE` lockfile pollution of subprocesses so per-gemfile lockfiles are created correctly
  - This approach:
    - Lets subprocess bundler start fresh and process the target gemfile cleanly
    - Preserves test isolation and prevents global config pollution
    - Enables committing appraisal lockfiles with specific bundler versions for stable, repeatable builds
  - This fix maintains backward compatibility with all bundler versions
