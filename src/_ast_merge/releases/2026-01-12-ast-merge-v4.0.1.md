## [4.0.1] - 2026-01-11

- TAG: [v4.0.1][4.0.1t]
- COVERAGE: 96.45% -- 2553/2647 lines in 51 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 87.41% -- 812/929 branches in 51 files
- 98.80% documented

### Added

- **`Ast::Merge::RSpec::MergeGemRegistry`** - Fully dynamic merge gem registration for RSpec dependency tags
  - `register(tag_name, require_path:, merger_class:, test_source:, category:)` - Register a merge gem
  - `available?(tag_name)` - Check if a merge gem is available and functional
  - `registered_gems` - Get all registered gem tag names
  - `gems_by_category(category)` - Filter gems by category (:markdown, :data, :code, :config, :other)
  - `summary` - Get availability status of all registered gems
  - Automatically defines `*_available?` methods on `DependencyTags` at registration time
  - External merge gems can now get full RSpec tag support without modifying ast-merge

### Changed

- Upgrade to [tree_haver v5.0.1](https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/releases/tag/v5.0.1)
- **`Ast::Merge::AstNode` now inherits from `TreeHaver::Base::Node`**
  - Ensures synthetic nodes stay in sync with the canonical Node API
  - Inherits `Comparable`, `Enumerable` from base class
  - Retains all existing methods and behavior (Point, Location, signature, etc.)
  - Constructor calls `super(self, source: source)` to properly initialize base class
- **RSpec Dependency Tags refactored to use MergeGemRegistry**
  - Removed hardcoded merge gem availability checks
  - Removed `MERGE_GEM_TEST_SOURCES` constant
  - `*_available?` methods are now defined dynamically when gems register
  - `any_markdown_merge_available?` now queries registry by category
  - RSpec exclusion filters are configured dynamically from registry
- `Ast::Merge::Testing::TestableNode` now delegates to `TreeHaver::RSpec::TestableNode`
  - The TestableNode implementation has been moved to tree_haver for sharing across all merge gems
  - `spec/support/testable_node.rb` now requires and re-exports the tree_haver version
  - Backward compatible: existing tests continue to work unchanged
- `spec/ast/merge/node_wrapper_base_spec.rb` refactored to use `TestableNode` instead of mocks
  - Real TreeHaver::Node behavior for most tests
  - Mocks only retained for edge case testing (e.g., invalid end_line before start_line)
