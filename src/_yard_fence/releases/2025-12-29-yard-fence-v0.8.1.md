## [0.8.1] - 2025-12-29

- TAG: [v0.8.1][0.8.1t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 129/129 lines in 4 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 40/40 branches in 4 files
- 40.00% documented

### Added

- `YARD_FENCE_CLEAN_DOCS` environment variable to optionally clear the `docs/` directory before regeneration
  - Set to `true` to enable; prevents stale HTML files from persisting when markdown source files are deleted

### Changed

- `prepare_tmp_files` now clears the `tmp/yard-fence/` staging directory before regenerating files
  - This prevents stale preprocessed files from persisting when source markdown files are deleted
  - Previously, files added manually or by other processes to `tmp/yard-fence/` would remain and get included in documentation
