Simple way to NOTIFY and LISTEN to channels in PostgreSQL

Standalone the listener client works great in an `irb` session.
Real-world, practical, use requires a long running process, and for an example of that see [bin/supervisor](https://github.com/pboling/celluloid-io-pg-listener/blob/master/bin/supervisor)
