| 📍 NOTE                                                                                                                                                           |

| RubyGems (the [GitHub org][rubygems-org], not the website) [suffered][draper-security] a [hostile takeover][ellen-takeover] in September 2025.                    |
| Ultimately [4 maintainers][simi-removed] were [hard removed][martin-removed] and a reason has been given for only 1 of those, while 2 others resigned in protest. |
| It is a [complicated story][draper-takeover] which is difficult to [parse quickly][draper-lies].                                                                  |
| I'm adding notes like this to gems because I [don't condone theft][draper-theft] of repositories or gems from their rightful owners.                              |
| If a similar theft happened with my repos/gems, I'd hope some would stand up for me.                                                                              |
| Disenfranchised former-maintainers have started [gem.coop][gem-coop].                                                                                             |
| Once available I will publish there exclusively; unless RubyCentral makes amends with the community.                                                              |
| The ["Technology for Humans: Joel Draper"][reinteractive-podcast] podcast episode by [reinteractive][reinteractive] is the most cogent summary I'm aware of.      |
| See [here][gem-naming], [here][gem-coop] and [here][martin-ann] for more info on what comes next.                                                                 |
| What I'm doing: A (WIP) proposal for [bundler/gem scopes][gem-scopes], and a (WIP) proposal for a federated [gem server][gem-server].                             |
