A JSON FUZZ Generator in Ruby from JSON Schema files.

This gem is a re-write & renaming of dead-since-2015 [`json-fuzz-generator`](https://github.com/deme0607/json-fuzz-generator),
It has been re-built on top of the modern [`json_schemer`](https://github.com/davishmcclurg/json_schemer)
instead of the unmaintained `json-schema`.
