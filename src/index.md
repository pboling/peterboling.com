Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the main index page of my website.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, blog posts, and other content that I have created.

My published open source projects are listed over at [Projects](./projects.erb),
where each project has its own mini blog. RSS feeds for project updates are available.
My latest general audience, or at least non-project-specific, blog posts can be found on the [Blog](./blog).
