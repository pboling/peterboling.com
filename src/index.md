Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the main index page of my website.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, blog posts, and other content that I have created.

My published open source projects are listed alphabetically over at [Projects](./projects.erb),
where each project has its own mini blog. RSS feeds for project updates are available.
An interactive listing of projects is available at <a href="https://galtzo.com">galtzo.com</a>.

I am a core maintainer of certain projects within the following OSS organizations:

* [appraisal-rb][appraisal-rb]
* [kettle-rb][kettle-rb]
* [floss-funding][floss-funding]
* [galtzo-floss][galtzo-floss]
* [omniauth][omniauth]
* [resque][resque]
* [rubocop-lts][rubocop-lts]
* [ruby-oauth][ruby-oauth]
* [ruby-openid][ruby-openid]
