Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the main index page of my website.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, blog posts, and other content that I have created.

My published open source projects are listed alphabetically over at [Projects](./projects),
where each project has its own mini blog. RSS feeds for project updates are available.
An interactive listing of projects is available at <a href="https://galtzo.com">galtzo.com</a>.

I am a core maintainer of projects within the following OSS organizations:

* [appraisal-rb][appraisal-rb] (3 projects)
* [kettle-rb][kettle-rb] (4 projects)
* [floss-funding][floss-funding] (3 projects)
