- The roots of this gem are ancient, and there are more modern options.
- This gem is based on OpenID 2.0, which is a **deprecated standard**.
- The modern alternative is called OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- This gem **does not** support OIDC.
- Many, if not all, of the [current security vulnerabilities](https://github.com/oauth-xx/masq2/security/code-scanning) **will not be fixed**.
- The purpose of this gem is to help legacy systems modernize, one step at a time, by allowing them to get onto modern Ruby / Rails.
- If you find this useful, please consider sponsoring me!
